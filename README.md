### Day 9:
**Today's Progress:**  
Today, I focused on using dictionaries and nesting in Python. I created a programming dictionary, managed student grades based on scores, and built a travel log using nested dictionaries and lists. Additionally, I implemented a secret bidding project to practice collecting user input and finding the highest bid.

**What I Learned:**  
- **Creating and Manipulating Dictionaries**: Explored how to create, modify, and clear dictionaries, as well as how to loop through keys and values.
- **Conditionals in Dictionaries**: Implemented a grading system by using conditionals to assign grades based on student scores.
- **Nesting in Dictionaries**: Learned how to create nested dictionaries to store related data, such as travel logs containing cities and the number of visits.
- **User Input and Bidding Logic**: Developed a secret bidding program where users can input their names and bids. The program tracks the highest bid and announces the winner.

**Challenges:**  
One challenge was managing the user input for the bidding system and ensuring that the program correctly identified the highest bid. Keeping the loop and conditionals organized was crucial to maintain functionality.

**Thoughts:**  
Working with dictionaries and nesting was enlightening, especially how they can be used to organize complex data structures. The secret bidder project was a fun way to apply what I learned about user interaction and data storage. I’m looking forward to expanding this project further!

Let me know if you’d like any adjustments!
